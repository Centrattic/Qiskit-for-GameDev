# Qiskit for GameDev

This is a repo to put useful tools for making games using [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit), IBM's open source framework for making software for quantum computers. Codes used here were derived from works of [James Weaver](https://github.com/JavaFXpert), [Huang Junye](https://github.com/HuangJunye) and [Asier Arranz](https://github.com/asierarranz).

There is also information here on using [MicroQiskit](https://github.com/qiskit-community/MicroQiskit/blob/master/README.md), a minimal reimplementation of Qiskit in various programming languages.

## Game engines

### Game engines that have been used with Qiskit
1. [Pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame): native python open soure framework for making games.

1. [Unity](https://unity.com): a very popular cross-platform game engine.

1. [Minetest](https://github.com/minetest/minetest): an open source Minecraft-like voxel game.

1. [Jupyter Wigets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): Not really a game engine, but a way of implementing interactivity with Python.

### Game engines that have been used with MicroQiskit

MicroQiskit can be used with all of the above, as well as the following.

1. [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php): a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. Very popular in game jams.

### Game engines we will target in future

1. [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot): a trending, free and open-source game engine.

## How to use?
Tutorials on how to use the tools here will be added soon. Please check examples of the usage in the examples below.

## Examples
### Pygame
* [Quantum Circuit Pygame](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/quantum-circuit-pygame): Quantum circuit game with Qiskit and Pygame

* [QPong](https://github.com/HuangJunye/QPong): Quantum version of the class Pong game.

* [PewPew+MicroQiskit](https://repl.it/@quantum_jim/PewPewMicroQiskit)

### Unity
* [QPong-Unity](https://github.com/HuangJunye/QPong-Unity): QPong rewritten in Unity, custom built for IBM Quantum Arcade machine.

### Minetest
* [QiskitBlocks](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/QiskitBlocks): Game that teaches quantum computing using Qiskit in a Minetest block world.

### Jupyter Widgets
* [Jupyter Widget game engine](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantumjim/jupyter-widget-game-engine/blob/master/jupyter_widget_game.ipynb): A simple game engine (and example game) that can be embedded in Jupyter notebooks and run the the IBM Quantum Experience.

### PICO-8
* [Fredventure](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=37368): A minimal PICO-8 game, with terrain generated by porting the single qubit algorithm explained [here](https://github.com/qiskit-community/MicroQiskit/blob/master/versions/MicroPython/tutorials/Terrain-Generator.ipynb).
