# Qiskit forGameDev
This is a repo to put useful tools for making games using [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit), IBM's open source framework for making software for quantum comptuers. Codes used here were derived from works of James Weaver, Huang Junye and Asier Arranz.

## Game engines
### Currently supported game engines
1. [Pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame): native python open soure framework for makin games.

1. [Unity](https://unity.com): a very popular cross-platform game engine.

1. [Minetest](https://github.com/minetest/minetest): an open source Minecraft-like voxel game.

### Future game engines
1. [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php): a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. Very popular in game jams.

1. [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot): a trending, free and open-source game engine.

## How to use?
Tutorials on how to use the tools here will be added soon. Please check examples of the usage in the examples below.
